                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>Tibet is home to distinct cultural traditions and astounding natural scenery, making it a top
                            destination among travelers.</li>
                        <li>The plateau of Tibet is the world’s highest plateau with an average elevation of over 4,500
                            meters.</li>
                        <li>World Heritage sites located in Tibet are, the Potala Palace, the Norbulingka Palace, and the
                            Jokhang Temple.</li>
                        <li>Buddhism is the foundation of Tibet’s culture and everyday life.</li>
                        <li>Tibet holds the third largest store of fresh water and ice in the world after the Arctic and

                    <p><strong>How we can Enter Tibet?</strong><br>
                        We can enter Tibet from Nepal and from Mainland China.</p>

                    <p><strong>From Nepal:</strong><br>
                        <u>By Air:</u> We have two direct flights between Lhasa and Kathmandu, run by Air China and Sichuan
                        Air. You get the stunning bird’s-eye view of the Himalayas including Mt. Everest, the world’s
                        highest peak flying from Nepal.<br><br>
                        <u>By Road:</u> Driving from Nepal is the most common way to enter Tibet. We have many cheap direct
                        international flights to Kathmandu; many tourists find it convenient to fly to Kathmandu then enter
                        Tibet via land. You can enter Tibet via Kerung border, Simikot border, and Kodari border. Due to the
                        Nepal earthquake in 2015, the Kodari border is temporarily closed. The Kerung border, which is 3
                        hours away from Kathmandu, is used. Note that the Simikot border is used mostly by travelers wishing
                        to tour/trek Mt. Kailash.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>From Mainland China:</strong><br>
                        <u>Train/Railway:</u> There are five routes that connect China and Tibet by train. The popular
                        choice is to take the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It takes 2 days for travelers to reach Lhasa from
                        Beijing. Travelling from Xining to Tibet takes around 21 hours. There is daily train service from
                        Shanghai to Tibet. The Chengdu-Tibet train departs every other day and takes around 43 hours. The
                        train ride from Guangzhou to Tibet is the longest and takes around 54 hours.<br><br>
                        <u>Flights:</u> Tourists can fly to Tibet from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu within 7 hours. At
                        present, there are direct flights to Lhasa from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shangri-la, Kunming,
                        Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xian, Xining, and Kathmandu. There are also several daily flights from Chengdu
                        to Shigatse and Nyingchi in Tibet.<br><br>
                        <u>By Land:</u> Entering Tibet via mainland China by land is very expensive and takes from 7 – 15
                        days. Qinghai-Tibet Highway (1937 km, an estimated 5–7 days), Xinjiang-Tibet Highway (2086 km, an
                        estimated 10–15 days).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Passport and Visa Information</strong><br>
                        Travelling to Tibet requires a Chinese visa and a Tibet Travel Permit which can both be obtained in
                        Kathmandu with the help of a travel company (Tibet via Nepal). A valid visa for China is not the
                        same as a Tibet Travel Permit. Those with a Chinese tourist visa will still need to apply for a
                        Tibet Travel Permit. The permit is still required for foreign travelers travelling to Tibet from
                        mainland China.<br><br>
                        To acquire the permit, you need to book a guide for your entire trip and pre-arrange private
                        transport for trips outside Lhasa. The trip outside Lhasa also requires additional permits which are
                        arranged by the company you are travelling with.</p>

                    <p><strong>Travel Insurance</strong><br>
                        Travel insurance is coverage designed to protect against risks and financial losses that could
                        happen while traveling. Tibet is a remote location, and if you become seriously injured or very
                        sick, you may need to be evacuated by air. Under these circumstances, you don’t want to be without
                        adequate health insurance. Be sure your policy covers evacuation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Banking and Foreign Exchange</strong><br>
                        The circulated currency in Tibet is renminbi (RMB). Foreign currency can be exchanged in the banks
                        there. All the branches of the Bank of China in Lhasa and other cities provide such services.
                        Chinese banks in Lhasa include Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial
                        Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China. Additionally, some 4/5 star hotels also offer
                        exchange services.<br><br>
                        Tibetans do not use and accept coins. You are also advised to carry enough cash if travelling to
                        remote areas in Shigatse, Shannan, Ngari, Nyingchi, and Nagqu where banking services are limited.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Electricity in Tibet</strong><br>
                        In Tibet, the power sockets are of type A, C, and I. The standard voltage is 220 V and the standard
                        frequency is 50 Hz. If the standard voltage in your country is between 220 – 240 V (as in the UK,
                        Europe, Australia, and most of Asia and Africa) you can easily use your electric appliances in
                        Tibet.<br><br>
                        However, if the standard voltage in your country is in the range of 100 V – 127 V (as in the US,
                        Canada, and most South American countries), you need a voltage converter in Tibet. You can bring
                        your own voltage converter as you might not find them in Tibetan stores. Alternately, you can also
                        buy them in Kathmandu (if travelling to Tibet via Nepal).<br><br>
                        If the label in your electric appliance states ‘INPUT: 100-240V, 50/60 Hz’ the appliance can be used
                        in all countries of the world. This is common for chargers of tablets/laptops, photo cameras, cell
                        phones, toothbrushes, etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>Drinking Water</strong><br>
                        It is not wise to drink tap water or ice made from tap water. Most hotels in urban areas including
                        Lhasa boil the water first before serving them hot or cold. However, when trekking in the more
                        remote areas you should boil your own water or treat it with water-purification tablets. Tea is
                        always safe to drink but you are advised to refrain from locally brewed alcohol as it’s often made
                        with contaminated well water. Large 5-liter bottles of drinking water are available in most
                        supermarkets.<br><br>
                        The water in Tibet is ‘hard water’ so you need to boil it at least for 10 minutes to purify it.
                        Consider purchasing a water filter for a long trip (often more economical than buying bottled
                        water). Total filters take out all parasites, bacteria, and viruses, and make water safe to
                        drink.<br><br>
                        Chlorine tablets (e.g., Puritabs or Steritabs) will kill many pathogens, but not giardia and amoebic
                        cysts. Iodine is more effective for purifying water and is available in liquid (Lugol’s solution) or
                        tablet (e.g., Potable Aqua) form. Follow the directions carefully and remember that too much iodine
                        can be harmful.</p>

                    <p><strong>Best Time to Visit Tibet</strong><br>
                        Visiting Tibet from May to September is the most popular season. The weather is warm with clear
                        skies. The snow/ice starts melting from April, clearing the blocked roads and making it easier for
                        you to visit various Tibetan villages. However, since this is the peak season, the prices are at
                        their highest.<br><br>
                        If you want to avoid crowds during your Tibet tour, you can visit Tibet in either April or between
                        October to November. The weather is cold but there are not a lot of tourists visiting, so you get
                        more options for hotels and vehicles.<br><br>
                        The lowest tourist season in Tibet is winter (Dec–Feb). The weather is very cold but you have all
                        the attractions to yourself.</p>
